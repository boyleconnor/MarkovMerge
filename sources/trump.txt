I thought that @CNN would get better after they failed so badly in their support of Hillary Clinton however, since election, they are worse
The Great State of Michigan was just certified as a Trump WIN giving all of our MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN supporters another victory  306
.@CNN is so embarrassed by their total  100 support of Hillary Clinton, and yet her loss in a landslide, that they dont know what to do.
@sdcritic  @HighonHillcrest @jeffzeleny @CNN There is NO QUESTION THAT #voterfraud did take place, and in favor of #CorruptHillary 
@FiIibuster @jeffzeleny Pathetic  you have no sufficient evidence that Donald Trump did not suffer from voter fraud, shame Bad reporter.
@JoeBowman12 @jeffzeleny just another generic CNN part time wannabe journalist   @CNN still doesnt get it. They will never learn

Serious voter fraud in Virginia, New Hampshire and California  so why isnt the media reporting on this Serious bias  big problem
states instead of the 15 states that I visited. I would have won even more easily and convincingly but smaller states are forgotten
It would have been much easier for me to win the socalled popular vote than the Electoral College in that I would only campaign in 3 or 4
In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally
Trump is going to be our President. We owe him an open mind and the chance to lead. So much time and money will be spent  same result Sad

during a general election. I, for one, am appalled that somebody that is the nominee of one of our two major parties would take that kind

Hillarys debate answer on delay That is horrifying. That is not the way our democracy works. Been around for 240 years. Weve had free 
Hillary Clinton conceded the election when she called me just prior to the victory speech and after the results were in. Nothing will change
The Democrats, when they incorrectly thought they were going to win, asked that the election night tabulation be accepted. Not so anymore
The Green Party scam to fill up their coffers by asking for impossible recounts is now being joined by the badly defeated amp demoralized Dems

Great meetings will take place today at Trump Tower concerning the formation of the people who will run our government for the next 8 years.
The failing @nytimes just announced that complaints about them are at a 15 year high. I can fully understand that  but why announce
Perhaps a new meeting will be set up with the @nytimes. In the meantime they continue to cover me inaccurately and with a nasty tone
I cancelled todays meeting with the failing @nytimes when the terms and conditions of the meeting were changed at the last moment. Not nice
Many people would like to see @NigelFarage represent Great Britain as their Ambassador to the United States. He would do a great job

Numerous patriots will be coming to Bedminster today as I continue to fill out the various positions necessary to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN

The Theater must always be a safe and special place.The cast of Hamilton was very rude last night to a very good man, Mike Pence. Apologize
Our wonderful future V.P. Mike Pence was harassed last night at the theater by the cast of Hamilton, cameras blazing.This should not happen
The ONLY bad thing about winning the Presidency is that I did not have the time to go through a long but winning trial on Trump U. Too bad
I settled the Trump University lawsuit for a small fraction of the potential award because as President I have to focus on our country.

I have recieved and taken calls from many foreign leaders despite what the failing @nytimes said. Russia, U.K., China, Saudi Arabia, Japan,
The failing @nytimes story is so totally wrong on transition. It is going so smoothly. Also, I have spoken to many foreign leaders.
I am not trying to get top level security clearance for my children. This was a typically false news story.
Very organized process taking place as I decide on Cabinet and many other positions. I am the only one who knows who the finalists are
The Electoral College is actually genius in that it brings all states, including the smaller ones, into play. Campaigning is much different
If the election were based on total popular vote I would have campaigned in  N.Y. Florida and California and won even bigger and more easily
The debates, especially the second and third, plus speeches and intensity of the large rallies, plus OUR GREAT SUPPORTERS, gave us the win
I will be interviewed on @60Minutes tonight after the NFL game  700 P.M. Enjoy

Mitt Romney called to congratulate me on the win. Very nice
The @nytimes sent a letter to their subscribers apologizing for their BAD coverage of me. I wonder if it will change  doubt it
Wow, the @nytimes is losing thousands of subscribers because of their very poor and highly inaccurate coverage of the Trump phenomena
This will prove to be a great time in the lives of ALL Americans. We will unite and we will win, win, win

The polls are close so Crooked Hillary is getting out of bed and will campaign tomorrow.Why did she hammer 13 devices and acidwash emails
The Great State of Arizona, where I just had a massive rally amazing people, has a very weak and ineffective Senator, Jeff Flake. Sad
The Republican Party needs strong and committed leaders, not weak people such as @JeffFlake, if it is going to stop illegal immigration.

Crooked Hillarys V.P. pick said this morning that I was not aware that Russia took over Crimea. A total lie  and taken over during O term
Wow, the failing @nytimes has not reported properly on Crookeds FBI release. They are at the back of the pack  no longer a credible source
.@CNN is so disgusting in their bias, but they are having a hard time promoting Crooked Hillary in light of the new email scandals.

Crooked Hillarys brainpower is highly overrated.Probably why her decision making is so bad or, as stated by Bernie S, she has BAD JUDGEMENT
Does anyone know that Crooked Hillary, who tried so hard, was unable to pass the Bar Exams in Washington D.C. She was forced to go elsewhere

CLINTON CORRUPTION AND HER SABOTAGE OF THE INNER CITIES. Full speech transcript 
Hillary Clinton only knows how to make a speech when it is a hit on me. No policy, and always very short stamina. Media gives her a pass
HRC is using the oldest play in the Dem playbook when their policies fail, they are left wthis one tired argument
Hillary Clinton is using racebaiting to try to get AfricanAmerican voters but they know she is all talk and NO ACTION
Hillary Clintons short speech is pandering to the worst instincts in our society. She should be ashamed of herself
Just watched recap of #CrookedHillarys speech. Very short and lies. She is the only one fearmongering
So many in the AfricanAmerican community are doing so badly, poverty and crime way up, employment and jobs way down I will fix it, promise

President Obama should have gone to Louisiana days ago, instead of golfing. Too little, too late
Hillary Clinton strongly stated  that there was absolutely no connection between her private work and that of The State Department. LIE

I am now in Texas doing a big fundraiser for the Republican Party and a @FoxNews Special on the BORDER and with victims of border crime

Certain Republicans who have lost to me would rather save face by fighting me than see the U.S.Supreme Court get proper appointments. Sad
Stay on message is the chant. I always do  trade, jobs, military, vets, 2nd A, repeal Ocare, borders, etc  but media misrepresents
I have always been the same personremain true to self.The media wants me to change but it would be very dishonest to supporters to do so
It is not freedom of the press when newspapers and others are allowed to say and write whatever they want even if it is completely false
I am not only fighting Crooked Hillary, I am fighting the dishonest and corrupt media and her government protection process. People get it
Crooked Hillary Clinton is being protected by the media. She is not a talented person or politician. The dishonest media refuses to expose
My rallies are not covered properly by the media. They never discuss the real message and never show crowd size or enthusiasm.
If the disgusting and corrupt media covered me honestly and didnt put false meaning into the words I say, I would be beating Hillary by 20
The failing @nytimes, which never spoke to me, keeps saying that I am saying to advisers that I will change. False, I am who I amnever said

Will CNN send its cameras to the border to show the massive unreported crisis now unfolding  or are they worried it will hurt Hillary
When will we see stories from CNN on Clinton Foundation corruption and Hillarys payforplay at State Department
CNN anchors are completely out of touch with everyday people worried about rising crime, failing schools and vanishing jobs.

#CrookedHillary  Obamas third term, which would be terrible news for our economic growth  seen below. 
Word is that Crooked Hillary has very small and unenthusiastic crowds in Pennsylvania. Perhaps it is because her husband signed NAFTA
I turned down a meeting with Charles and David Koch. Much better for them to meet with the puppets of politics, they will do much better
Why doesnt the media want to report that on the two Big Thursdays when Crooked Hillary and I made our speeches  Republicans won ratings
#CrookedHillary 
Crooked Hillary Clinton is soft on crime, supports open borders, and wants massive tax hikes. A formula for disaster
Violent crime is rising across the United States, yet the DNC convention ignored it. Crime reduction will be one of my top priorities.
Just got back from Colorado. The love and enthusiasm at two rallies was incredible. Big crowds

We are suffering through the worst longterm unemployment in the last 70 years. I want change  Crooked Hillary Clinton does not.
Hillary can never win over Bernie supporters. Her foreign wars, NAFTATPP support amp Wall Street ties are driving away millions of votes.
Colorado was amazing yesterday So much support. Our tax, trade and energy reforms will bring great jobs to Colorado and the whole country.

What Bernie Sanders really thinks of Crooked Hillary Clinton. 
I am watching Crooked Hillary speak. Same old stuff, our country needs change
Wow, my campaign is hearing from more and more Bernie supporters that they will NEVER support Crooked Hillary. She sold them out, V.P. pick
In Hillary Clintons America  things get worse. #TrumpPence16 
The dishonest media didnt mention that Bernie Sanders was very angry looking during Crookeds speech. He wishes he didnt make that deal
Thank you Facebook Instagram  
Crooked Hillary said that I couldnt handle the rough and tumble of a political campaign. Really,I just beat 16 people and am beating her
If Michael Bloomberg ran again for Mayor of New York, he wouldnt get 10 of the vote  they would run him out of town  #NeverHillary
Little Michael Bloomberg, who never had the guts to run for president, knows nothing about me. His last term as Mayor was a disaster
General John Allen, who I never met but spoke against me last night, failed badly in his fight against ISIS. His record  BAD  #NeverHillary
Crooked Hillary Clinton mentioned me 22 times in her very long and very boring speech. Many of her statements were lies and fabrications

CAMPAIGN STATEMENT 
Two policemen just shot in San Diego, one dead. It is only getting worse. People want LAW AND ORDER
Crooked Hillary Clinton made up facts about me, and forgot to mention the many problems of our country, in her very average scream
The media coverage this morning of the very average Clinton speech and Convention is a joke. @CNN and the little watched @MorningJoe  SAD
No one has worse judgement than Hillary Clinton  corruption and devastation follows her wherever she goes.
Hillarys wars in the Middle East have unleashed destruction, terrorism and ISIS across the world.
Hillarys vision is a borderless world where working people have no power, no jobs, no safety.
Hillary will never reform Wall Street. She is owned by Wall Street
Our way of life is under threat by Radical Islam and Hillary Clinton cannot even bring herself to say the words.
Hillarys refusal to mention Radical Islam, as she pushes a 550 increase in refugees, is more proof that she is unfit to lead the country.
Departing now  thank you Cedar Rapids, Iowa. This is a MOVEMENT

Dems warn not to underestimate Trumps potential win
Great to be back in Iowa #TBT with @JerryJrFalwell joining me in Davenport this past winter. #MAGA 
Median household income is down for the middle class since Obama took office. It will only go further down under Clinton.
A vote for ClintonKaine is a vote for TPP, NAFTA, high taxes, radical regulation, and massive influx of refugees.

Join our next Vice President, @MikePence in Wisconsin tonight amp Michigan ThursdayMI WI 
Not one American flag on the massive stage at the Democratic National Convention until people started complainingthen a small one. Pathetic
Our not very bright Vice President, Joe Biden, just stated that I wanted to carpet bomb the enemy. Sorry Joe, that was Ted Cruz
Crooked Hillary Clinton wants to flood our country with Syrian immigrants that we know little or nothing about. The danger is massive. NO
Hopefully the violent and vicious killing by ISIS of a beloved French priest is causing people to start thinking rationally. Get tough
The Democratic Convention has paid ZERO respect to the great police and law enforcement professionals of our country. No recognition  SAD
Funny how the failing @nytimes is pushing Dems narrative that Russia is working for me because Putin said Trump is a genius. America 1st
As I have been saying, Crooked Hillary will approve the job killing TPP after the election, despite her statements to the contrary top adv.
Just like I have warned from the beginning, Crooked Hillary Clinton will betray you on the TPP. 
Many of Bernies supporters have left the arena. Did Bernie go home and go to sleep
I hate to say it, but the Republican Convention was far more interesting with a much more beautiful set than the Democratic Convention
No matter what Bill Clinton says and no matter how well he says it, the phony media will exclaim it to be incredible. Highly overrated
You have no idea what my strategy on ISIS is, and neither does ISIS a good thing. Please get your facts straight  thanks. @megynkelly
For the record, I have ZERO investments in Russia.
In order to try and deflect the horror and stupidity of the Wikileakes disaster, the Dems said maybe it is Russia dealing with Trump. Crazy
Dems dont want to talk ISIS bc Hillarys foreign interventions unleashed ISIS amp her refugee plans make it easier for them to come here.
Bernies exhausted, he just wants to shut down and go home to bed
The invention of email has proven to be a very bad thing for Crooked Hillary in that it has proven her to be both incompetent and a liar

Pocahontas bombed last night Sad to watch.
Why arent the Democrats speaking about ISIS, bad trade deals, broken borders, police and law and order. The Republican Convention was great
Funny, if you listen to @FoxNews, the Democrats did not have a good day. If you listen to the other two, they are fawning. What a difference
Bernie Sanders totally sold out to Crooked Hillary Clinton. All of that work, energy and money, and nothing to show for it Waste of time.
Elizabeth Warren, often referred to as Pocahontas, just misrepresented me and spoke glowingly about Crooked Hillary, who she always hated
Sad to watch Bernie Sanders abandon his revolution. We welcome all voters who want to fix our rigged system and bring back our jobs.
If Cory Booker is the future of the Democratic Party, they have no future I know more about Cory than he knows about himself.
I was at @FoxNews and met Juan Williams in passing.  He asked if he could have pictures taken with me. I said fine. He then trashes on air
Hard to believe that Bernie Sanders has done such a complete fold. He got NOTHING for all of the time, energy and money. The V.P. a joke
While Bernie has totally given up on his fight for the people, we welcome all voters who want a better future for our workers.
Clinton betrayed Bernie voters. Kaine supports TPP, is in pocket of Wall Street, and backed Iraq War.

Great POLL numbers are coming out all over. People dont want another four years of Obama, and Crooked Hillary would be even worse. #MAGA
The State of Florida is so embarrassed by the antics of Crooked Hillary Clinton and Debbie Wasserman Schultz that they will vote for CHANGE
Wow, the Republican Convention went so smoothly compared to the Dems total mess. But fear not, the dishonest media will find a good spinnnn
Here we go again with another Clinton scandal, and emails yet can you believe. Crooked Hillary knew the fix was in, B never had a chance
Crooked Hillary Clinton knew everything that her servant was doing at the DNC  they just got caught, thats all They laughed at Bernie.
If Bernie Sanders, after seeing the just released emails, continues to look exhausted and done, then his legacy will never be the same.
Thank you #MakeAmericaGreatAgain 
Hillary was involved in the email scandal because she is the only one with judgement so bad that such a thing could have happened
How much BAD JUDGEMENT was on display by the people in DNC in writing those really dumb emails, using even religion, against Bernie
The new joke in town is that Russia leaked the disastrous DNC emails, which should never have been written stupid, because Putin likes me
Watched Crooked Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine on 60 Minutes. No way they are going to fix Americas problems. ISIS amp all others laughing
The ratings for the Republican National Convention were very good, but for the final night, my speech, great. Thank you
The highly neurotic Debbie Wasserman Schultz is angry that, after stealing and cheating her way to a Crooked Hillary victory, shes out
The Democrats are in a total meltdown but the biased media will say how great they are doing Emails say the rigged system is alive amp well
Even though Bernie Sanders has lost his energy and his strength, I dont believe that his supporters will let Crooked Hillary off the hook
Crooked Hillary Clinton was not at all loyal to the person in her rigged system that pushed her over the top, DWS. Too bad Bernie flamed out
If the Republican Convention had blown up with emails, resignation of boss and the beat down of a big player. Bernie, media would go wild
The @CNN panels are so one sided, almost all against Trump. @FoxNews is so much better and the ratings are much higher. Dont watch CNN
I always said that Debbie Wasserman Schultz was overrated. The Dems Convention is cracking up and Bernie is exhausted, no energy left
Today proves what I have always known, that @Reince Priebus is the tough one and the smart one, not Debbie Wasserman Shultz @DWStweets.
Sorry folks, but Bernie Sanders is exhausted, just cant go on any longer. He is trying to dismiss the new emails and DNC disrespect. SAD
There is no longer a Bernie Sanders political revolution. He is turning out to be a weak and somewhat pathetic figure,wants it all to end
An analysis showed that Bernie Sanders would have won the Democratic nomination if it were not for the Super Delegates.
Looks like the Bernie people will fight. If not, their BLOOD, SWEAT AND TEARS was a total waste of time. Kaine stands for opposite
Wow, President Obamas brother, Malik, just announced that he is voting for me. Was probably treated badly by presidentlike everybody else
Bernie Sanders started off strong, but with the selection of Kaine for V.P., is ending really weak. So much for a movement TOTAL DISRESPECT
The Crooked Hillary V.P. choice is VERY disrespectful to Bernie Sanders and all of his supporters. Just another case of BAD JUDGEMENT by H

@OliMauritania @realDonaldTrump Kaine supported the stupidest deal in the history of deals  #HillaryKaine2016
Thank you to everyone for the wonderful reviews of my speech on Thursday night. From the heart
The Wikileaks email release today was so bad to Sanders that it will make it impossible for him to support her, unless he is a fraud
Just saw Crooked Hillary and Tim Kaine together. ISIS and our other enemies are drooling. They dont look presidential to me
I will bring jobs back and get wages up. People havent had a real wage increase in almost twenty years. Clinton killed jobs
Tim Kaine has been praising the Trans Pacific Partnership and has been pushing hard to get it approved. Job killer
Funny that the Democrats would have their convention in Pennsylvania where her husband and her killed so many jobs. I will bring jobs back
Crooked Hillary Clinton has destroyed jobs and manufacturing in Pennsylvania. Against steelworkers and miners. Husband signed NAFTA.
Leaked emails of DNC show plans to destroy Bernie Sanders. Mock his heritage and much more. Online from Wikileakes, really vicious. RIGGED
Pocahontas wanted V.P. slot so badly but wasnt chosen because she has done nothing in the Senate. Also, Crooked Hillary hates her
Tim Kaine is, and always has been, owned by the banks. Bernie supporters are outraged, was their last choice. Bernie fought for nothing
The Bernie Sanders supporters are furious with the choice of Tim Kaine, who represents the opposite of what Bernie stands for. Philly fight
@TheresaCali @realDonaldTrump General Michael Flynn will make a great Secretary of Defense when you become POTUS #MakeAmericaSafeAgain
I highly recommend the just out book  THE FIELD OF FIGHT  by General Michael Flynn. How to defeat radical Islam.
Is it the same Kaine that took hundreds of thousands of dollars in gifts while Governor of Virginia and didnt get indicted while Bob M did
Another attack, this time in Germany. Many killed. God bless the people of Munich.

STATEMENT ON MELANIA SPEECH
The media is spending more time doing a forensic analysis of Melanias speech than the FBI spent on Hillarys emails.
Good news is Melanias speech got more publicity than any in the history of politics especially if you believe that all press is good press
In November, I think the people of Ohio will remember that the Republicans picked Cleveland instead of going to another state. Jobs
Bill Hemmer of @FoxNews was very nice in explaining the excitement and energy in the arena. More than in past years.
Congratulations to my children, Don and Tiffany, on having done a fantastic job last night. I am very proud of you
Such a great honor to be the Republican Nominee for President of the United States. I will work hard and never let you down AMERICA FIRST

Our country is totally divided and our enemies are watching. We are not looking good, we are not looking smart, we are not looking tough

I will be on @60Minutes tonight at 700 P.M. with Mike Pence talking about LAW AND ORDER and many other subjects Bad times for divided USA
We are TRYING to fight ISIS, and now our own people are killing our police. Our country is divided and out of control. The world is watching
We grieve for the officers killed in Baton Rouge today. How many law enforcement and people have to...
The ratings at @FoxNews blow away the ratings of @CNN  not even close. Thats because CNN is the Clinton News Network and people dont like
.@FoxNews is much better, and far more truthful, than @CNN, which is all negative. Guests are stacked for Crooked Hillary I dont watch.
If Goofy Elizabeth Warren, a very weak Senator, didnt lie about her heritage being Native American she would be nothing today. Pick her H
I hope that Crooked Hillary picks Goofy Elizabeth Warren, sometimes referred to as Pocahontas, as her V.P. Then we can litigate her fraud
It doesnt matter that Crooked Hillary has experience, look at all of the bad decisions she has made. Bernie said she has bad judgement
As the days and weeks go by,  we see what a total mess our country and world is in  Crooked Hillary Clinton led Obama into bad decisions
We are going to have a great time in Cleveland. Will lead to special results for our country. We will Make America Great Again
Goofy Elizabeth Warren, who may be the least productive Senator in the U.S. Senate, must prove she is not a fraud. Without the con its over

Crooked Hillary Clinton is bought and paid for by Wall Street, lobbyists and special interests. She will sell our country down the tubes
Very sad that a person who has made so many mistakes, Crooked Hillary Clinton, can put out such false and vicious ads with her phony money
Crooked Hillary, who embarrassed herself and the country with her email lies, has been a DISASTER on foreign policy. Look whats happening
Crooked Hillary is spending big Wall Street money on ads saying I dont have foreign policy experience, yet look what her policies have done

Even the @NYTimes and @WashingtonPost Editorial Boards condemned Justice Ginsburg for her ethical and legal breach. What was she thinking
Is Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg going to apologize to me for her misconduct Big mistake by an incompetent judge
On my way to San Diego to raise money for the Republican Party. I am spending a lot myself and also helping others.
Voters understand that Crooked Hillarys negative ads are not true just like her email lies and her other fraudulent activity.
Despite spending 500k a day on TV ads alone #CrookedHillary falls flat in nationwide @QuinnipiacPoll. Having ZERO impact. Sad
Lyin Crooked Hillarys email stories all have one thing in common. 
Is President Obama trying to destroy Israel with all his bad moves Think about it and let me know

Bernie sanders has abandoned his supporters by endorsing prowar proTPP proWall Street Crooked Hillary Clinton.
Bernie Sanders endorsing Crooked Hillary Clinton is like Occupy Wall Street endorsing Goldman Sachs.
#CrookedHillary is not qualified
I am somewhat surprised that Bernie Sanders was not true to himself and his supporters. They are not happy that he is selling out
Bernie Sanders, who has lost most of his leverage, has totally sold out to Crooked Hillary Clinton. He will endorse her today  fans angry
This election is a choice between law, order amp safety  or chaos, crime amp violence. I will make America safe again for everyone. #ImWithYou

The media is so dishonest. If I make a statement, they twist it and turn it to make it sound bad or foolish.They think the public is stupid
President Obama thinks the nation is not as divided as people think. He is living in a world of the make believe
Look what is happening to our country under the WEAK leadership of Obama and people like Crooked Hillary Clinton. We are a divided nation

To all of my twitter followers, please contribute whatever you can to the campaign. We must beat Crooked Hillary. 
Convention speaker schedule to be released tomorrow. Let today be devoted to Crooked Hillary and the rigged system under which we live.
I have over seven million hits on social media re Crooked Hillary Clinton. Check it out Sleepy Eyes, @MarkHalperin @NBCPolitics
Sleepy eyes Chuck Todd, a man with so little touch for politics, is at it again.He could not have watched my standing ovation speech in N.C.
Even the once great Caesars is bankrupt in A.C. Others to follow. Ask the Democrat City Council what happened to Atlantic City.
Hillary Clinton should ask why the Democrat pols in Atlantic City made all the wrong moves  Convention Center, Airport  and destroyed City
I made a lot of money in Atlantic City and left 7 years ago, great timing as all know. Pols made big mistakes, now many bankruptcies.
Crooked Hillary Clinton lied to the FBI and to the people of our country. She is sooooo guilty. But watch, her time will come
The rigged system may have helped Hillary Clinton escape criminal charges, but... 
Crooked Hillary has once again been proven to be a person who is dishonest, incompetent and of very bad judgement.
Crooked Hillary Clinton and her team were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information. Not fit
Crooked Hillary Clinton is unfit to serve as President of the U.S. Her temperament is weak and her opponents are strong. BAD JUDGEMENT
I dont think the voters will forget the rigged system that allowed Crooked Hillary to get away with murder. Come November 8, shes out
Raised a lot of money for the Republican Party. There will be a big gasp when the figures are announced in the morning. Lots of support Win
I will be interviewed by @oreillyfactor tonight on @FoxNews at 11pm. Enjoy
My son, @EricTrump will be interviewed by @SeanHannity tonight at 10pm on @FoxNews. Enjoy
Looking forward to meeting with @SenBobCorker in a little while. We will be traveling to North Carolina together today.
FBI director said Crooked Hillary compromised our national security. No charges. Wow #RiggedSystem
The system is rigged. General Petraeus got in trouble for far less. Very very unfair As usual, bad judgment.
It was great spending time with @joniernst yesterday. She has done a fantastic job for the people of Iowa and U.S. Will see her again
Taxpayers are paying a fortune for the use of Air Force One on the campaign trail by President Obama and Crooked Hillary. A total disgrace
On @FoxNews at 700 P.M. Special Meet the Trumps Hope you enjoy
Why is President Obama allowed to use Air Force One on the campaign trail with Crooked Hillary She is flying with him tomorrow. Who pays
With Hillary and Obama, the terrorist attacks will only get worse. Politically correct fools, wont even call it what it is  RADICAL ISLAM
Crooked Hillary Clinton is guilty as hell but the system is totally rigged and corrupt Where are the 33,000 missing emails
The only people who are not interested in being the V.P. pick are the people who have not been asked
I look forward to meeting @joniernst today in New Jersey. She has done a great job as Senator of Iowa
Spent time with Indiana Governor Mike Pence and family yesterday. Very impressed, great people
Senator Tom Cotton was great on Meet the Press yesterday. Despite a totally onesided interview by Chuck Todd, the end result was solid
Dishonest media is trying their absolute best to depict a star in a tweet as the Star of David rather than a Sheriffs Star, or plain star
Happy 4th of July #Trump2016 #AmericaFirst  
Crooked Hillary will NEVER be able to handle the complexities and danger of ISIS  it will just go on forever. We need change
The third mass attack slaughter in days by ISIS. 200 dead in Baghdad, worst in many years. We do not have leadership that can stop this
In Bangladesh, hostages were immediately killed by ISIS terrorists if they were unable to cite a verse from the Koran. 20 were killed
I believe that Crooked Hillary sent Bill to have the meeting with the U.S.A.G. So Bill is not in trouble with H except that he got caught
The SECRET meeting between Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. in back of closed plane was heightened with FBI shouting go away, no pictures.
Does anybody really believe that Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. talked only about grandkids and golf for 37 minutes in plane on tarmac
THE SYSTEM IS RIGGED
On Saturday a great man, Elie Wiesel, passed away.The world is a better place because of him and his belief that good can triumph over evil
Crooked Hillary Clinton knew that her husband wanted to meet with the U.S.A.G. to work out a deal. The system is totally rigged amp corrupt
Only a fool would believe that the meeting between Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. was not arranged or that Crooked Hillary did not know.
Just watched @meetthepress and how totally biased against me Chuck Todd, and the entire show, is against me.The good newsthe people get it
It was just announcedby sourcesthat no charges will be brought against Crooked Hillary Clinton. Like I said, the system is totally rigged
It is impossible for the FBI not to recommend criminal charges against Hillary Clinton. What she did was wrong What Bill did was stupid

.@TraceAdkins great job on FOX this morning. Keep up the good work
Take a look at what happened w Bill Clinton. The system is totally rigged. Does anybody really believe that meeting was just a coincidence
Bill Clintons meeting was a total secret. Nobody was to know about it but he was caught by a local reporter.
As Bernie Sanders said, Hillary Clinton has bad judgement. Bills meeting was probably initiated and demanded by Hillary
#ThrowbackThursday #Trump2016
I will be interviewed by @SeanHannity tonight at 10pm on FOX Enjoy
The reason I put up approximately 50 million for my successful primary campaign is very simple, I want to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN
I have self funded my winning primary campaign with an approx. 50 million loan. I have totally terminated the loan
The very dishonest @NBCNews refuses to accept the fact that I have forgiven my 50 million loan to my campaign. Done deal
One of the reasons Hillary hid her emails was so the public wouldnt see how she got rich selling out America. 
Why would college graduates want Crooked Hillary as their President She will destroy them 
New book by @ericbolling is absolutely terrific and a must read #WakeUpAmerica
The story with Hillary will never change. 
RT @DRUDGEREPORT 4339 
For reasons only they can explain, the @USChamber wants to continue our bad trade deals rather than renegotiating and making them better.
Tremendous day in Massachusetts and Maine. Thank you to everyone for making it so special
@Gengm7 @jakeda @realDonaldTrump As of April this year, Hillary had spent 264,000,000 on her campaign Mr.Trump 55,000,000. self funding

Just watched Senator John Barrasso on @FoxNews  He was great Thank you John.
Why would the USChamber be upset by the fact that I want to negotiate better and stronger trade deals or that I want penalties for cheaters
The @USCHAMBER must fight harder for the American worker. China, and many others, are taking advantage of U.S. with our terrible trade pacts
Iron Mike Tyson was not asked to speak at the Convention though Im sure he would do a good job if he was. The media makes everything up
@jtsbk  @AllenWest thanks for sharing Eric we need @realDonaldTrump now as this administration is incapable of keeping our country safe
We must do everything possible to keep this horrible terrorism outside the United States.
Yet another terrorist attack, this time in Turkey. Willthe world ever realize what is going on So sad.
Hillary Clintons Presidency would be catastrophic forthe future of our country. She is illfit with bad judgment.
Benghazi is just another Hillary Clinton failure. It justnever seems to work the way its supposed to with Clinton.

.@CNN is all negative when it comes to me. I dont watch it anymore.
The media is unrelenting. They will only go with and report a story in a negative light. I called Brexit Hillary was wrong, watch November
Crooked Hillary is wheeling out one of the least productive senators in the U.S. Senate, goofy Elizabeth Warren, who lied on heritage.

The dirty poll done by @ABC @washingtonpost is a disgrace. Even they admit that many more Democrats were polled. Other polls were good.
Crooked Hillary Attacks Foreign Government Donations  While Ignoring Her Own 
Crooked Hillary Clinton got Brexit wrong. I said LEAVE will win. She has no sense of markets and such bad judgement. Only a question of time
Hillary Clinton is not a change agent, just the same old status quo She is spending a fortune, I am spending very little. Close in polls
People in our country want borders, and without them the old line pols like Crooked Hillary will not win. It is time for CHANGE  and JOBS
Top 50 Facts About Crooked Hillary Clinton From Trump Stakes Of The Election Address 
The @ABC poll sample is heavy on Democrats.  Very dishonest  why would they do that Other polls good
Crooked Hillary just took a major ad of me playing golf at Turnberry. Shows me hitting shot, but I never did  lie Was there to support son
Clinton is trying to wash away her bad judgement call on BREXIT with big dollar ads. Disgraceful
Crooked Hillary Clinton, who called BREXIT 100 wrong along with Obama, is now spending Wall Street money on an ad on my correct call.
George Will, one of the most overrated political pundits who lost his way long ago, has left the Republican Party.Hes made many bad calls
Just landed in New York  a one night stay in Scotland. Turnberry came out magnificently. My son, Eric, did a great job  under budget
Obama has blocked ICE officers and BP from doing their jobs. That ends when I am President
I have never liked the media term mass deportation  but we must enforce the laws of the land
We only want to admit those who love our people and support our values. #AmericaFirst
We must suspend immigration from regions linked with terrorism until a proven vetting method is in place.
Thank you to everyone who came out amp joined us @TrumpTurnberry yesterday @EricTrump @IvankaTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr

@Jolena3 @realDonaldTrump And we will get it back once we have President Trump Cant wait
@DarrenWaggener @realDonaldTrump What has happened in the UK in the last 12 hours is exactly what will happen in November..vote TRUMP 2016
Many people are equating BREXIT, and what is going on in Great Britain, with what is happening in the U.S. People want their country back
The opening of Trump Turnberry in Scotland was a big success. Good timing, I was here for BREXIT. Very exciting news conference today
Crooked Hillary called it totally wrong on BREXIT  she went with Obama  and now she is saying we need her to lead. She would be a disaster
I want all Americans to succeed together. President Obamas illegal executive amnesty undermines job prospects for...
New Government data by the Center for Immigration Studies shows more than 3M new legal amp illegal immigrants settled..
America is proud to stand shouldertoshoulder wa free amp ind UK. We stand together as friends, as allies, amp as a people wa shared history.
Selfdetermination is the sacred right of all free peoples, and the people of the UK have exercised that right for all the world to see.
Getting ready to open the magnificent Turnberry in Scotland. What a great day, especially when added to the brave amp brilliant vote.
Statement Regarding British Referendum on E.U. Membership
Just arrived in Scotland. Place is going wild over the vote. They took their country back, just like we will take America back. No games
Congratulations to my son, Eric, on the fantastic job he has done in rebuilding Turnberry, and its great Ailsa Course. Always support kids
Leaving now for a one night trip to Scotland in order to be at the Grand Opening of my great Turnberry Resort. Will be back on Sat. night
Meet the amazing mother whose letter I read during my speech. She lost her son to policies supported by Clinton. 
Read my full statement here on the Supreme Courts executive amnesty decision #imwithyou 
Here is another CNN lie. The Clinton News Network is losing all credibility. Im not watching it much anymore.  
CNN, which is totally biased in favor of Clinton, should apologize. They knew they were wrong.  
RT @ScottAdamsSays Trumps speech today is the best persuasion I have ever seen. Game over. Now running unopposed  
Our inner cities have been left behind. We will never have the resources to support our people if we have an open border.
On immigration, Im consulting with our immigration officersamp our wageearners. Hillary Clinton is consulting with Wall Street.
Obama amp Clinton should stop meeting with special interests, amp start meeting with the victims of illegal immigration.
Hillary Clintons open borders are tearing American families apart. I am going to make our country Safe Again for all Americans. #Imwithyou
SC has kept us safe from exec amnestyfor now. But Hillary has pledged to expand it, taking jobs from Hispanic amp AfricanAmerican workers.
RT @FoxBusiness .@JerryJrFalwell I was so impressed by @realDonaldTrumps speech yesterday. He was the best Ive ever seen him.

@chrisboydbrew @LouDobbs @realDonaldTrump @FoxBusiness.. Saw your interview.You are the best Great questions, great answers Lou is great
Crooked Hillary refuses to say that she will be raising taxes beyond belief She will be a disaster for jobs and the economy
I will be interviewed by @LouDobbs tonight on @FoxBusiness 7pm ET
Hillary defrauded America as Secy of State. She used it as a personal hedge fund to get herself rich Corrupt, dangerous, dishonest.
If you want to know about Hillary Clintons honesty amp judgment, ask the family of Ambassador Stevens.
Hillary took money and did favors for regimes that enslave women and murder gays.
I am the king of debt.That has been great for me as a businessman, but is bad for the country. I made a fortune off of debt, will fix U.S.
ObamaClinton inherited 10T in debt and turned it into nearly 20T.  They have bankrupted 
Hillary Clintons open borders immigration policies will drive down wages for all Americans  and make everyone less safe.
How can Hillary run the economy when she cant even send emails without putting entire nation at risk
Hillary Clinton surged the trade deficit with China 40 asSecretary of State, costing Americans millions of jobs.
Hillary says this election is about judgment.  Shes right.  Her judgement has killed thousands, unleashed ISIS and wrecked the economy.
I will be making a big speech tomorrow to discuss the failed policies and bad judgment of Crooked Hillary Clinton.
Crooked Hillary Clinton is totally unfit to be our presidentreally bad judgement and a temperament, according to new book, which is a mess
When I said that if, within the Orlando club, you had some people with guns, I was obviously talking about additional guards or employees

In my speech on protecting America I spoke about a temporary ban, which includes suspending immigration from nations tied to Islamic terror.

Congratulations to the 2016 #StanleyCup Champions, Pittsburgh @Penguins
I am watching @FoxNews and how fairly they are treating me and my words, and @CNN, and the total distortion of my words and what I am saying
I will be going to New Hampshire today, home of my first primary victory, to discuss terror and the horrible events of yesterday. 230 P.M.
I have been hitting Obama and Crooked Hillary hard on not using the term Radical Islamic Terror. Hillary just brokesaid she would now use
What has happened in Orlando is just the beginning. Our leadership is weak and ineffective. I called it and asked for the ban. Must be tough
@WandaWalls20 @realDonaldTrump Please make us safe. We cannot have Hillary as president. We will be in so much trouble.
Reporting that Orlando killer shouted Allah hu Akbar as he slaughtered clubgoers. 2nd man arrested in LA with rifles near Gay parade.
Is President Obama going to finally mention the words radical Islamic terrorism If he doesnt he should immediately resign in disgrace
Appreciate the congrats for being right on radical Islamic terrorism, I dont want congrats, I want toughness amp vigilance. We must be smart
Horrific incident in FL. Praying for all the victims amp their families. When will this stop When will we get tough, smart amp vigilant
Clinton made a false ad about me where I was imitating a reporter GROVELING after he changed his story. I would NEVER mock disabled. Shame
Really bad shooting in Orlando. Police investigating possible terrorism. Many people dead and wounded.
Goofy Elizabeth Warren, sometimes referred to as Pocahontas, pretended to be a Native American in order to advance her career. Very racist

As expected, the media is very much against me. Their dishonesty is amazing but, just like our big wins in the primaries, we will win
@KathyCeurter @realDonaldTrump please Mr.Trump make @SenatorJeffSessions your VP. He is a perfect running mate.  He is a great guy

I am getting bad marks from certain pundits because I have a small campaign staff. But small is good, flexible, save money and number one
A massive blow to Obamas message  only 38,000 new jobs for month in just issued jobs report. Thats REALLY bad
Crooked Hillary is being badly criticized for a Wall Street paid for ad by PolitiFact for a false ad on me on women. She is a total fraud
Crooked Hillary Clinton has not held a news conference in more than 7 months. Her record is so bad she is unable to answer tough questions
Just like I have been able to spend far less money than  others on the campaign and finish #1, so too should our country. We can be great
People like @KatyTurNBC report on my campaign, but have zero access. They say what they want without any knowledge.True of so much of media
Hillary Clinton is unfit to be president. She has bad judgement, poor leadership skills and a very bad and destructive track record. Change
I am watching @CNN very little lately because they are so biased against me. Shows are predictable garbage CNN and MSM is one big lie
The Clinton News Network, sometimes referred to as @CNN, is getting more and more biased.They act so indignanthear them behind closed doors

So I raisedgave 5,600,000 for the veterans and the media makes me look bad They do anything to belittle  totally biased.
Congratulations to @seanhannity on his tremendous increase in television ratings. Speaking of ratings I will be on his show tonight @ 10pE.
I am getting great credit for my press conference today. Crooked Hillary should be admonished for not having a press conference in 179 days.
Katie Couric, the third rate reporter, who has been largely forgotten, should be ashamed of herself for the fraudulent editing of her doc.
I will be interviewed on @seanhannity tonight at 10pmE on @FoxNews. Enjoy
Join me in Sacramento, Californiatomorrow evening @ 7pm #Trump2016 
So many veterans groups are beyond happy with all of the money I raisedgave It was my great honor  they do an amazing job.
Just finished a press conference in Trump Tower wherein I gave information on which VETERANS groups got the 5,600,000 that I raisedgave
I have raisedgiven a tremendous amount of money to our great VETERANS, and have got nothing but bad publicity for doing so. Watch
So many great things happening  new poll numbers looking good News conference at 1100 A.M. today, Trump Tower
I should have easily won the Trump University case on summary judgement but have a judge, Gonzalo Curiel, who is totally biased against me.
I have a judge in the Trump University civil case, Gonzalo Curiel San Diego, who is very unfair. An Obama pick. Totally biasedhates Trump
I hope everyone had a great Memorial Day
I would have had millions of votes more in the primaries than Crooked Hillary if I only had one opponent, instead of sixteen. Broke record
Have a great Memorial Day and remember that we will soon MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN
@NBCDFW Trump rallies veterans at annual Rolling Thunder Gathering  
@FrankyLamouche how many of donalds rolling thunder brigade will sign up and go to war for him in the middle east.
@MariaErnandez3b Trump Supports Rolling Thunder Rally #TRUMP STRONG  So true, and remember the M.I.A.s
@ScottWRasmussen Donald Trump and Bikers Share Affection at Rolling Thunder Rally  A great day in D.C.
@TeaPartyNevada #Trump2016 Illegals are taken care of better than our veterans.   
The endorsement of me by the 16,500 Border Patrol Agents was the first time that they ever endorsed a presidential candidate. Nice
In getting the endorsement of the 16,500 Border Patrol Agents thank you, the statement was made that the WALL was very necessary
Obama says a WALL at our southern border wont enhance our security wrong and yet he now wants to build a much bigger wall fence at W.H.
If dummy Bill Kristol actually does get a spoiler to run as an Independent, say good bye to the Supreme Court
The Republican Party has to be smart amp strong if it wants to win in November. Cant allow lightweights to set up a spoiler Indie candidate
Bill Kristol has been wrong for 2yrsan embarrassed loser, but if the GOP cant control their own, then they are not a party. Be tough, Rs
Good news is that my campaign has perhaps more cash than any campaign in the history of politics bc I stand 100 behind everything we do.
Heading to D.C. to see and hear ROLLING THUNDER. Amazing people that LOVE OUR COUNTRY. Great spirit
Honor Memorial Day by thinking of and respecting all of the great men and women that gave their lives for us and our country We love them.
Does President Obama ever discuss the sneak attack on Pearl Harbor while hes in Japan Thousands of American lives lost. #MDW
Dont believe the biased and phony media quoting people who work for my campaign. The only quote that matters is a quote from me
I am always on the front page of the failing @nytimes, but when I won the GOP nomination, Im in the back of the paper. Very dishonest
The media is on a new phony kick about my management style. I spend much less money amp get much better results What we need as Prez
The failing @nytimes wrote a story about my management style amp that I dont have many people. I have 73, Hillary has 800 amp Im beating her.
I we broke the alltime record for most votes gotten in a Republican Primary  by a lot  and with many states left to go Thank you.
The U.S. has 69 treaties with other countries where we would have to defend them and their borders. How nice, but what do we get NOT ENOUGH
Great rally in Fresno, California great crowd Thank you #Trump2016

I find it offensive that Goofy Elizabeth Warren, sometimes referred to as Pocahontas, pretended to be Native American to get in Harvard.
Thank you Mr. amp Mrs. @TomBarrackJr for the wonderful and magical evening last night. It will not be forgotten. #Trump2016
.@kimguilfoyle just watched you on @OutnumberedFNC thank you
The Inspector Generals report on Crooked Hillary Clinton is a disaster. Such bad judgement and temperament cannot be allowed in the W.H.
Thank you Anaheim, California#Trump2016 
Thank you Washington Honored to say, on behalf of our great movement, we have broken the all time record for votes in GOP primary history.
The protesters in New Mexico were thugs who were flying the Mexican flag. The rally inside was big and beautiful, but outside, criminals
Crooked Hillary Clinton just cant close the deal with Bernie. I had to knock out 16 very good and smart candidates. Hillary doesnt have it
Goofy Senator Elizabeth Warren @elizabethforma has done less in the U.S. Senate than practically any other senator. All talk, no action
@elizabethforma  Goofy Elizabeth Warren, sometimes known as Pocahontas, bought foreclosed housing and made a quick killing. Total hypocrite
@gordonsr1052  Washington, BIG Thank You for supporting Trump We are all going to help Trump Make America Great Again Trump2016

Thank you Washington #Trump2016#MakeAmericaGreatAgain 
Great honor to receive todays endorsement of @RickSantorum. Really nice #Trump2016
After raising, w no obligation, almost 6M for Vets, I couldnt believe protesters formed @ Trump Tower. JUST OUT SENT BY CROOKED HILLARY
Thank you @DailyMail for setting the failing @NYTimes story straight. This is what the NYTs should have written 
A suggestion for the dishonest media 
A wonderfully written article concerning Israel by @JasonDovEsq 
A great new book has been written about Crooked Hillary. Read it amp you will never be able to vote for her. @EdKlein 
Crooked Hillary Clinton overregulates, overtaxes and doesnt care about jobs. Most importantly, she suffers from plain old bad judgement
I just released my financial disclosure forms, the largest numbers in the history of the F.E.C. Even the dishonest media thinks great
Amazingly, with all of the money I have raised for the vets, I have got nothing but bad publicity from the dishonest and disgusting media.
Much of the money I have raised for our veterans has already been distributed, with the rest to go shortly to various other veteran groups.
While under no obligation to do so, I have raised between 5 amp 6 million dollars, including 1million dollars from me, for our VETERANS. Nice
Join me in California or Montana52516 Anaheim, California52616 Billings, Montana
I will be interviewed on @oreillyfactor at 800 P.M. Enjoy
Obamas VA Secretary just said we shouldnt measurewait times. Hillary says VA problems are not widespread. I will take care ofour vets
Is Hillary really protecting women 
In trade, military and EVERYTHING else, it will be AMERICA FIRST This will quickly lead to our ultimate goal MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN
Thank you America #Trump2016 
The American people are sick and tired of not being able to lead normal lives and to constantly be on the lookout for terror and terrorists
Bernie Sanders is continuing his quest because he believes that Crooked Hillary Clinton will be forced out of the race  email scandal
Join me on Wednesday, May 25th at the Anaheim Convention Center#Trump2016 #MAGA Tickets  
Crooked Hillary wants a radical 500 increase in Syrian refugees. We cant allow this. Time to get smart and protect America
How can Crooked Hillary say she cares about women when she is silent on radical Islam, which horribly oppresses women
RT @gatewaypundit BREAKING POLL Trump Gains 11 Points on Clinton Since Marchgt Now Leads Crooked Hillary 4644  vi
Why do the networks continue to put dopey @BillKristol on panels when he has called every single shot about me wrong for 2 yrs
Hillary Clinton is not qualified to be president because her judgement has been proven to be so bad Would be four more years of stupidity
Crooked Hillary said that I  want guns brought into the school classroom. Wrong
@dubilujane I trust @realDonaldTrump more anyone ever to protect America.He WILL do the right thing for the U.S.A, without a  doubt.
Thank you to all of the men and women who have served our country. You are our true heroes #ArmedForcesDay 
Crooked Hillary Clintons foreign interventions unleashed ISIS in Syria, Iraq and Libya. She is reckless and dangerous
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN 
.@CNN is so negative, getting even worse as I get closer. Just had two antiTrump losers with zero rebuttal from my team. Turning off
@RBacliff Hillary wants to rip the guns out of Americas hands. No guns  no protection. Get on #TrumpTrain amp join @NRA to stop her.
Crooked Hillary wants to get rid of all guns and yet she is surrounded by bodyguards who are fully armed. No more guns to protect Hillary
While our wonderful president was out playing golf all day, the TSA is falling apart, just like our government Airports a total disaster
Crooked Hillary is spending tremendous amounts of Wall Street money on false ads against me. She is a very dishonest person
Crooked Hillary Clinton wants to essentially abolish the 2nd Amendment. No gun owner can ever vote for Clinton
Thank you @TheTodaysGolfer for the wonderful statement that the new par 3 9th hole @Trump Turnberry could be the most dramatic in Britain.
@montgomeriefdn  Colin, great to have you at Trump Turnberry. So proud of you and your GREAT playing You made winning MAJORS look easy

A Call for Unity by Jason Greenblatt @JasonDovEsq 
Crooked Hillary cant even close the deal with Bernie  and the Dems have it rigged in favor of Hillary. Four more years of this No way
Crooked Hillary Clinton looks presidential I dont think so Four more years of Obama and our country will never come back. ISIS LAUGHS
Look where the world is today, a total mess, and ISIS is still running around wild. I can fix it fast, Hillary has no chance
Crooked Hillary has zero imagination and even less stamina. ISIS, China, Russia and all would love for her to be president. 4 more years
I said that Crooked Hillary Clinton is not qualified to be president because she has very bad judgement  Bernie said the same thing
Thank you @LtStevenLRogers. We will respond to terrorism with strength in 2017
How quality a woman is Rowanne Brewer Lane to have exposed the @nytimes as a disgusting fraud  Thank you Rowanne.
Looks like yet another terrorist attack. Airplane departed from Paris. When will we get tough, smart and vigilant Great hate and sickness
My list of potential U.S. Supreme Court Justices was very well recieved. During the next number of weeks I may be adding to the list

#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 
Thank you Louisiana #Trump2016 
Thank you Arizona See you soon#MakeAmericaGreatAgain 
Why did Clinton supporter @AlisonForKY declare Crooked Hillary winner in KY when AP hasnt even called the race
Bernie Sanders is being treated very badly by the Democrats  the system is rigged against him. Many of his disenfranchised fans are for me
Paul Begala, the dopey @CNN flunky and head of the ProHillary Clinton Super PAC, has knowingly committed fraud in his first ad against me.
@ShoneeP @realDonaldTrump Trump for President Bernie is a joke, knows nothing  and Hillary is yesterdays and todays nightmare
@MagicMetalNinja  The Trump movement will not be stopped. We support Trump because he is a true American looking out for #AmericaFIRST.

I will be live tweeting @megynkelly Show in 10 minutes. Should be interesting. Will be on Fox Network ENJOY
Wall Street paid for ad is a fraud, just like Crooked Hillary Their main line had nothing to do with women, and they knew it. Apologize
Do you think Crooked Hillary will finally close the deal If she cant win Kentucky, she should drop out of race. System rigged
I will be live tweeting my interview with @megynkelly on the Fox Network tonight at 8 Enjoy 
I look forward to watching @megynkelly tonight, 8 PM ET. It will be interesting to see how she treats meI think she will be very fair.
How can Crooked Hillary put her husband in charge of the economy when he was responsible for NAFTA, the worst economic deal in U.S. history
Crooked Hillary said her husband is going to be in charge of the economy.If so, he should run,not her.Will he bring the energizer to D.C.
#VoteTrump at clerks offices amp 185 ballot drop boxes in #ORPrimaryCloses at 8pm 
Crooked Hillary cant close the deal with Bernie Sanders. Will be another bad day for her
Amazing that Crooked Hillary can do a hit ad on me concerning women when her husband was the WORST abuser of woman in U.S. political history
Oregon is voting today. Keep the big numbers going  VOTE TRUMP MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN
Crooked Hillary Clinton put out an ad where I am misquoted on women. Cant believe she would misrepresent the facts My hit was on China
The pathetic new hit ad against me misrepresents the final line. You can tell them to go BLANK themselves  was about China, NOT WOMEN
Wow, 30,000 emails were deleted by Crooked Hillary Clinton. She said they had to do with a wedding reception. Liar How can she run
@AprilLaJune OREGON votes today Go vote for @realDonaldTrump and kick it BIG TIME 
What Barbara Res does not say is that she would call my company endlessly, and for years, trying to come back. I said no.
I gave a woman named Barbara Res a top N.Y. construction job, when that was unheard of, and now she is nasty. So much for a nice thank you
In politics, and in life, ignorance is not a virtue. This is a primary reason that President Obama is the worst president in U.S. history
The writer of the now proven false story in the @nytimes, Michael Barbaro, who was interviewed on CBS this morning, was unable to respond.
Over 50 women were interviewed by the @nytimes yet they only wrote about 6. Thats because there were so many positive statements.
No wonder the @nytimes is failingwho can believe what they write after the false, malicious amp libelous story they did on me.
The failing @nytimes is greatly embarrassed by the totally dishonest story they did on my relationship with women.
Rowanne Brewer, the most prominently depicted woman in the failing @nytimes story yesterday joined @foxandfriends. 
Thank you, Anthony @Scaramucci @WSJ The Entrepreneurs Case for Trump  
With the coming forward today of the woman central to the failing @nytimes hit piece on me, we have exposed the article as a fraud
A political commentator for @cnn, which I no longer watch, said Trump showed some weakness in the Repub Primaries. I set alltime record
Wow, Rowanne Brewer, the most prominently depicted woman in the failing @nytimes story yesterday, was on @foxandfriends saying Times lied
The @nytimes is so dishonest. Their hit piece cover story on me yesterday was just blown up by Rowanne Brewer, who said it was a lie
That was an amazing interview on @foxandfriends  I hope the rest of the media picks it up to show how totally dishonest the @nytimes is
Bernie Sanders is being treated very badly by the Dems. The system is rigged against him. He should run as an independent Run Bernie, run.
Great new poll thank you#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 
The @washingtonpost report on potential VP candidates is wrong. Marco Rubio and most others mentioned are NOT under consideration.
Thank you Georgia See you soon#Trump2016 
The media is really on a witchhunt against me. False reporting, and plenty of it  but we will prevail
Why did the failing @nytimes refuse to use any of the names given to them that I was so proud to have helped with their careers. DISHONEST
Wow, I have had so many calls from high ranking people laughing at the stupidity of the failing @nytimes piece. Massive front page for that
Why doesnt the failing @nytimes write the real story on the Clintons and women The media is TOTALLY dishonest
@TakingItBack  @nytimes keep shining....the ppl will not let the media dim your light...we no longer believe them #Trump2016 Thanks.
@tzard000 @realDonaldTrump @nytimes Everyone continues to pile onto Donald, but they can NEVER take away our votes  Thank you
Everyone is laughing at the @nytimes for the lame hit piece they did on me and women.I gave them many names of women I helpedrefused to use
@DistlerJoyce @realDonaldTrump @nytimes OHIO WOMEN FOR TRUMP 
@MrTohNey Leicester amp DonaldTrump seem to have the same trajectory, both were written off, but they keep scaling the heights. History
@QueenCharlotteO @realDonaldTrump @nytimes Im a women amp I 100 support @realDonaldTrump amp I have since the beginning. Thank you
The failing @nytimes wrote yet another hit piece on me. All are impressed with how nicely I have treated women, they found nothing. A joke
Thank you for the nice words this morning @KellyRiddell. Well delivered and totally logical @CNN   @FoxNews
@stranahan Sheldon Adelson Pledges 100 Million to Elect Trump President  Breitbart 
Wow, @CNN is really working hard to make me look as bad  as possible. Very unprofessional. Hurting in ratings  bad television
Great new poll thank you 
If Crooked Hillary Clinton cant close the deal on Crazy Bernie, how is she going to take on China, Russia, ISIS and all of the others
An incredible honor to receive the endorsement of a person Ihave such tremendous respect for. Thank you, Sheldon 
.@thehill  Your story about me amp the carbon tax is absolutely incorrectit is just the opposite. I will not support or endorse a carbon tax
Senator Lindsey Graham called me yesterday, very much to my surprise, and we had a very interesting talk about national security, and more

Great day in D.C. with @SpeakerRyan and Republican leadership. Things working out really well #Trump2016 
If it were up to goofy Elizabeth Warren, wed have no jobs in Americashe doesnt have a clue.
In interview I told @AP that my taxes are under routine audit and I would release my tax returns when audit is complete, not after election
Isnt it funny when a failed Senator like goofy Elizabeth Warren can spend a whole day tweeting about Trump amp gets nothing done in Senate
Goofy Elizabeth Warren lied when she says I want to abolish the Federal Minimum Wage. See mediaasking for increase
Our Native American Senator, goofy Elizabeth Warren, couldnt care less about the American workerdoes nothing to help
Goofy Elizabeth Warren is now using the womans card like her friend crooked Hillary. See her dumb tweet when a woman stands up to you
If the people of Massachusetts found out what an ineffective Senator goofy Elizabeth Warren has been, she would lose
Thanks Piers. 
#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 
RT @dmartosko Duck Dynasty star Phil Robertson says hell back Trump for president  via @MailOnline
Goofy Elizabeth Warren didnt have the guts to run for POTUS. Her phony Native American heritage stops that and VP cold.
Goofy Elizabeth Warren has been one of the least effective Senators in the entire U.S. Senate. She has done nothing
I dont want to hit Crazy Bernie Sanders too hard yet because I love watching what he is doing to Crooked Hillary. His time will come

It was Rosie ODonnell who ate the cake in the vicious Hillary commercial about me, not Crooked Hillary @marthamaccallum
Why does the media, with a strong push from Crooked Hillary, keep pushing the false narrative that I want to raise taxes. Exactly opposite

Join me in Washington todaySpokane ticketsLynden tickets 
Goofy Elizabeth Warren is weak and ineffective. Does nothing. All talk, no action  maybe her Native American name
Goofy Elizabeth Warren and her phony Native American heritage are on a Twitter rant. She is too easy Im driving her nuts.
Crooked Hillary Clinton wants completely open borders. Millions of Democrats will run from her over this and support me.
Just met with courageous family of Sarah Root in Nebraska. Sarah was horribly killed by illegal immigrant, but leaves behind amazing legacy.
Goofy Elizabeth Warren, Hillary Clintons flunky, has a career that is totally based on a lie. She is not Native American.
Lets properly check goofy Elizabeth Warrens records to see if she is Native American. I say shes a fraud
I hope corrupt Hillary Clinton chooses goofy Elizabeth Warren as her running mate. I will defeat them both.
Response to @LindseyGrahamSC
I hear @JoeNBC of rapidly fading @MorningJoe is pushing hard for a third party candidate to run. This will guarantee a Crooked Hillary win.
Joe Scarborough initially endorsed Jeb Bush and Jeb crashed, then John Kasich and that didnt work. Not much power or insight
Thank you to teachers across America When I become POTUS we will make education a far more important component of our life than it is now.
Crooked Hillary has ZERO leadership ability. As Bernie Sanders says, she has bad judgement. Constantly playing the womens card  it is sad
Paul Ryan said that I inherited something very special, the Republican Party. Wrong, I didnt inherit it, I won it with millions of voters
@Ausbiz  Many would say that you are the only talented person running for the top job this time #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #TrumpTrain
So many great endorsements yesterday, except for Paul Ryan We must put America first and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN
Governor Rick Perry said Donald Trump is one of the most talented people running for the Presidency Ive ever seen. Thank you Rick

On the way to the great state of Rhode Island big rally. Then to Pennsylvania for rest of day and night
Kasich just announced that he wants the people of Indiana to vote for him. Typical politician  cant make a deal work.
Shows how weak and desperate Lyin Ted is when he has to team up with a guy who openly cant stand him and is only 1 win and 38 losses.
Lyin Ted Cruz and 1 for 38 Kasich are unable to beat me on their own so they have to team up collusion in a two on one. Shows weakness
Lyin Ted and Kasich are mathematically dead and totally desperate. Their donors amp special interest groups are not happy with them. Sad
Wow, just announced that Lyin Ted and Kasich are going to collude in order to keep me from getting the Republican nomination. DESPERATION
I am happy to hear how badly the @nytimes is doing. It is a seriously failing paper with readership which is way down. Becoming irrelevant

Cruz said Kasich should leave because he couldnt get to 1237. Now he cant get to 1237. Drop out LYIN Ted.
Both Ted Cruz and John Kasich have no path to victory. They should both drop out of the race so that the Republican Party can unify
Senator Ted Cruz has been MATHEMATICALLY ELIMINATED from race. He said Kasich should get out for same reason. I think both should get out
I will be doing the @TODAYshow with my wife, Melania, and the rest of my family in a major Town Hall. Hopefully, it will be fun Enjoy.7A.M.

Lyin Ted Cruz even voted against Superstorm Sandy aid and September 11th help. So many New Yorkers devastated. Cruz hates New York
New York, we will make America great again 
Kasich only looks O.K. in polls against Hillary because nobody views him as a threat and therefore have placed ZERO negative ads against him
Lyin Ted Cruz cant win with the voters so he has to sell himself to the bossesI am millions of VOTES ahead Hillary would destroy him amp K

I would have millions of votes more than Hillary except for the fact that I had 17 opponents and she just had a socialist named Bernie
Crooked Hillary Clinton is spending a fortune on ads against me. I am the one person she doesnt want to run against. Will be such fun
Lyin Ted Cruz cant get votes I am millions ahead of him so he has to get his delegates from the Republican bosses. It wont work
Lyin Ted Cruz will never be able to beat Hillary. Despite a rigged delegate system, I am hundreds of delegates ahead of him.

Trump defends campaign manager charged for bruising a reporter
Thank you #MakeAmericaGreatAgain 
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN
Why is this reporter touching me as I leave news conference What is in her hand 
This was the reporters statement when she found out there was tape from my facility, she changed her tune. 
Victory press conference was over. Why is she allowed to grab me and shout questions Can I press charges 
Why arent people looking at this reporters earliest statement as to what happened, that is before she found out the episode was on tape
Wow, Corey Lewandowski, my campaign manager and a very decent man, was just charged with assaulting a reporter. Look at tapesnothing there
How come the @TODAYshow amp @chucktodd show the new @NBCNews Poll for Hillary vs Bernie but do not show the SAME poll where I am killing Cruz
I have millions more voteshundreds more dels than Cruz or Kasich, and yet am not being treated properly by the Republican Party or the RNC.
Wow, @CNN has nothing but my opponents on their shows. Really onesided and unfair reporting. Maybe I shouldnt do their townhall tonight
We need to secure our borders ASAP. No games, we must be smart, tough and vigilant. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN amp MAKE AMERICA STRONG AGAIN
Lyin Ted, I have already beaten you in all debates, and am way ahead of you in votes and delegates. You should focus on jobs amp illegal imm
LyinTed Cruz is weak amp losing big, so now he wants to debate again. But, according to Drudge,Time and online polls, I have won all debates
After the way I beat Gov. Scott Walker and Jeb, Rand, Marco and all others in the Presidential Primaries, no way he would ever endorse me
@PaulaDuvall2  Cruz will say anything that is contrary to what you have to say. If youre for Motherhood, hell be against it
Just released that international gangs are all over our cities. This will end when I am President
@wolfblitzer  Campaigntodate popular GOP totals @realDonaldTrump 7,546,980 @tedcruz 5,481,737 @JohnKasich 2,724,749 A BIG DIFFERENCE
Ted Cruz is incensed that I want to refocus NATO on terrorism, as well as current mission, but also want others to PAY FAIR SHARE, a must

I will be interviewed on @foxandfriends at 730. Things are looking good, had a great Easterlook forward to spending the week in Wisconsin
@VictorConkle #WIPrimary @realDonaldTrump will defeat ISIS and #MakeAmericaGreatAgain 
The United States cannot continue to make such bad, onesided trade deals. There are only so many jobs we can give up. No more
See Lyin Ted, even the @DailyBeast no fan of mine says this story came from Rubio, not Trump 
Just to show you how unfair Republican primary politics can be, I won the State of Louisiana and get less delegates than CruzLawsuit coming
Why cant the pundits be honest Hopefully we are all looking for a strong and great country again. I will make it strong and great  JOBS
Another radical Islamic attack, this time in Pakistan, targeting Christian women amp children. At least 67 dead,400 injured. I alone can solve
Happy Easter to all, have a great day
My statement on NATO being obsolete and disproportionately too expensive and unfair for the U.S. are now, finally, receiving plaudits
Wow, sleepy eyes @chucktodd is at it again. He is do totally biased. The things I am saying are correct.  far better vision than the others
I am interviewed on This Week on @ABC this morning. Enjoy
Remember, I am the only candidate who is selffunding. While I am given little credit for this by the voters, I am not bought like others
Dont believe the @FoxNews Polls, they are just another phony hit job on me. I will beat Hillary Clinton easily in the General Election.
Wisconsins economy is doing poorly and like everywhere else in U.S., jobs are leaving. I will make our economy strong again  bring in jobs
Nobody will protect our Nation like Donald J. Trump. Our military will be greatly strengthened and our borders will be strong. Illegals out
Lyin Ted Cruz is now trying to convince prople that his problems with The National Enq.were caused by me. I had NOTHING to do with story
The press is going out of their way to convince people that I do not like or respect women, when they know that it is just the opposite
The media is so after me on women  Wow, this is a tough business. Nobody has more respect for women than Donald Trump
@pattiandsammi @gullakhta99 @realDonaldTrump @Tytan01 @CNN WOMEN LOVE TRUMP. TRUMPS EXECS PREDOMINANTLY FEMALE. #WOMEN4TRUMP

@stanColtrane Turns out @glennbeck was wrong. @realDonaldTrump had nothing to do with it 
@theAgeofLeo Your instincts on foreign policy amp terrorism have been better than all of these so called experienced politicians combined.
Top suspect in Paris massacre, Salah Abdeslam, who also knew of the Brussels attack, is no longer talking. Weak leaders, ridiculous laws
@11phenomenon #LyingTed blames @realDonaldTrump for so many things I am starting to think he is having a mental health crisis.
Wow, just released that 67 million in negative ads was spent on me. How am I still number one  by a lot
I didnt start the fight with LyinTed Cruz over the GQ cover pic of Melania, he did. He knew the PAC was putting it out  hence, Lyin Ted
Just won a big federal lawsuit similar in certain ways to the Trump U case but the press refuses to write about it. If I lostmonster story

Endorsements for Lyin Ted Cruz 
@NeilTurner @realDonaldTrump Cruz amp Rubio are scared WATCH gt  
Europe and the U.S. must immediately stop taking in people from Syria. This will be the destruction of civilization as we know it So sad
Just announced that as many as 5000 ISIS fighters have infiltrated Europe. Also, many in U.S.  I TOLD YOU SO I alone can fix this problem
@DoctorSFreud  @TheView Theyre all braindead puppets with skeletons in their closet. I say you go on and destroy them all A dead show
Explain how the women on The View, which is a total disaster since the great Barbara Walters left, ever got their jobs. @abc is wasting time
.@TheView T.V. show, which is failing so badly that it will soon be taken off thr air, is constantly asking me to go on. I TELL THEM NO
Hillary Clinton has been working on solving the terrorism problem for years. TIME FOR A CHANGE, I WILL SOLVE  AND FAST
@TimVincent56  @LindseyGrahamSC Talkers think about the future, Doers are already building it #VoteTrump2016 
It is amazing how often I am right, only to be criticized by the media. Illegal immigration, take the oil, build the wall, Muslims, NATO
Remember when I recently said that Brussels is a hell hole and a mess and the failing @nytimes wrote a critical article. I was so right
These politicians like Cruz and Graham, who have watched ISIS and many other problems develop for years, do nothing to make things better
.@LindseyGrahamSC and Lyin Ted Cruz are two politicians who are very much alike  ALL TALK AND NO ACTION Both talk about ISIS, do nothing
It is amazing how @LindseyGrahamSC gets on so many T.V. shows talking negatively about me when I beat him so badly ZERO in his pres run
@missi51 .@realDonaldTrump thank God is not a politician, but hes one heck of a fighter who will fight for us, the people.
We pay a disproportionate share of the cost of N.A.T.O. Why It is time to renegotiate, and the time is now
N.A.T.O. is obsolete and must be changed to additionally focus on terrorism as well as some of the things it is currently focused on
@DonVito08 A picture is worth a thousand words @realDonaldTrump  #LyingTed #NeverCruz  @MELANIATRUMP 
@Kj11100Me @realDonaldTrump Donald Trump will be greater  president than Ragan. Trump will set the button for morality,Christianity.

@DebraRakestraw  You have over 2M followers more than than @HillaryClinton. This says something about how America feels. #Trump2016 
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN
I want to thank @RealSheriffJoe for all of his help in our historic Arizona win. Could not have done it without you Joe
While I believe I will clinch before Cleveland and get more than 1237 delegates, it is unfair in that there have been so many in the race
I think having Jebs endorsement hurts Lyin Ted. Jeb spent more than 150,000,000 and got nothing. I spent a fraction of that and am first
I will be the best by far in fighting terror. Im the only one that was right from the beginning, amp now Lyin Ted amp others are copying me.
Just watched Hillary deliver a prepackaged speech on terror. Shes been in office fighting terror for 20 years and look where we are
Low energy Jeb Bush just endorsed a man he truly hates, Lyin Ted Cruz. Honestly, I cant blame Jeb in that I drove him into oblivion
Lyin Ted Cruz steals foreign policy from me, and lines from Michael Douglas just another dishonest politician.
Thank you, Arizona #Trump2016#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #TrumpTrain 
Lyin Ted Cruz denied that he had anything to do with the G.Q. model photo post of Melania. Thats why we call him Lyin Ted
Hopefully the Republican Party can come together and have a big WIN in November, paving the way for many great Supreme Court Justices
Much bigger win than anticipated in Arizona. Thank you, I will never forget
Thank you, Arizona #Trump2016#WesternTuesday #TrumpTrain 
Incompetent Hillary, despite the horrible attack in Brussels today, wants borders to be weak and openand let the Muslims flow in.  No way
Lyin Ted Cruz just used a picture of Melania from a G.Q. shoot in his ad. Be careful, Lyin Ted, or I will spill the beans on your wife
Pres. Obama should leave the baseball game in Cuba immediately amp get home to Washington where a #POTUS, under a serious emergency belongs
Obama, and all others, have been so weak, and so politically correct, that terror groups are forming and getting stronger Shame.

President Obama looks and sounds so ridiculous making his speech in Cuba, especially in the shadows of Brussels. He is being treated badly
Do you all remember how beautiful and safe a place Brussels was. Not anymore, it is from a different world U.S. must be vigilant and smart
@MyPresidentme Heres Trump #AIPAC2016 in case anyone missed it. It is a must watch.

Mitt Romney is a mixed up man who doesnt have a clue. No wonder he lost
Failed Presidential Candidate Mitt Romney was campaigning with John Kasich amp Marco Rubio, and now he is endorsing Ted Cruz. 12
Failed presidential candidate Mitt Romney, the man who choked and let us all down, is now endorsing Lyin Ted Cruz. This is good for me
Going to Salt Lake City, Utah, for a big rally. Lyin Ted Cruz should not be allowed to win there  Mormons dont like LIARS I beat Hillary
Club for Growth letter trying to extort 1,000,000.00 from me. Remember, I said NO 
Club For Growth tried to extort 1,000,000 from me. When I said NO, they went hostile with negative ads. Disgraceful
With millions of dollars of negative and phony ads against me by the establishment, my numbers continue to go up. Can anyone explain this
.@EWErickson got fired like a dog from RedStateand now he is the one leading opposition against me.
Senator @LindseyGrahamSC made horrible statements about @SenTedCruz  and then he endorsed him. No wonder nobody trusts politicians
Lyin Ted Cruz lost all five races on Tuesdayand he was just given the jinx  a Lindsey Graham endorsement. Also backed Jeb. Lindsey got 0

Who should star in a reboot of Liar Liar Hillary Clinton or Ted Cruz Let me know. 
Highly overrated amp crazy @megynkelly is always complaining about Trump and yet she devotes her shows to me. Focus on others Megyn
Looking like my 5 victories on Tuesday will be just as good as if I won Ohio. Two more days and Ohio was mine
See you in Arizona on Friday and Saturday. 
Please explain to the dummies at the @WSJ  Editorial Board that I love to debate and have won, according to Drudge etc., all 11 of them
.@WSJ is bad at math. The good news is, nobody cares what they say in their editorials anymore, especially me
.@WSJ Editorial says Clinton primary vote total is 8,646,551.Trumps is 7,533,692a knock. But she had only 3 opponentsI had 16.Apologize
The reason lyin Ted Cruz has lost so much of the evangelical vote is that they are very smart and just dont tolerate liarsa big problem
Crazy @megynkelly is now complaining that  @oreillyfactor did not defend her against me  yet her bad show is a total hit piece on me.Tough
Great news that @FoxNews has cancelled the additional debate. How many times can the same people ask the same question I beat Cruz debating
Crazy @megynkelly supposedly had lyin Ted Cruz on her show last night. Ted is desperate and his lying is getting worse. Ted cant win
Stuart Stevens, the failed campaign manager of Mitt Romneys historic loss, is now telling the Republican Party what to do with Trump. Sad

@BertShad Was going to watch @Foxnews for the primary results but saw @megynkelly  looks like #CNN tonight
Word is that, despite a record amount spent on negative and phony ads, I had a massive victory in Florida. Numbers out soon
A lot of complaints from people saying my name is not on the ballot in various places in Florida Hope this is false.
I will bring our jobs back to the U.S., and keep our companies from leaving. Nobody else can do it. Our economy will sing again.
In presidential voting so far, John Kasich is ZERO for 22. So why would he be a good candidate Hillary would beat him, I will beat Hillary
Ohio is losing jobs to Mexico, now losing Ford and many others. Kasich is weak on illegal immigration. We need strong borders now
Watching John Kasich being interviewed  acting so innocent and like such a nice guy. Remember him in second debate, until I put him down.

Good morning Ohio Some additional information from my daughter, @IvankaTrump #VoteTrump #SuperTuesday 
Dont reward Mitt Romney, who let us all down in the last presidential race, by voting for Kasich who voted for NAFTA, open borders etc..
Please remember, I am the ONLY candidate who is selffunding his campaign. Kasich, Rubio and Cruz are all bought and paid for by lobbyists
I will bring our jobs back to America, fix our military and take care of our vets, end Common Core and ObamaCare, protect 2nd A, build WALL
Rubio is weak on illegal immigration, with the worst voting record in the U.S. Senate in many years. He will never MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN
Kasich voted for NAFTA, a disaster for Ohio, and now wants the even worse TPP approved. Vote Trump and end this madness

Because Gov. Kasich cannot run in the state of Pennsylvaniahe cannot win the nomination amp should not be allowed to compete in Ohio on Tue.
Carly Fiorina I agree Ted Cruz is just another politician. All talk no action
Thank you Kevin. With unification of the party, Republican wins will be massive 
Gov.Kasich of Ohio just stated on a morning show that he doesnt watch politics or anything on television, he only watches the @GolfChannel
Ohio Gov.Kasich voted for NAFTA, from which Ohio has never recovered. Now he wants TPP, which will be even worse. Ohio steel and coal dying
Bernie Sanders is lying when he says his disruptors arent told to go to my events. Be careful Bernie, or my supporters will go to yours
@alextrent4 It is repulsive that Trump was assaultedpoliticians used that 2 further themselves2 further victimize Trump DISGUSTING
Wow, Kasich didnt qualify to run in the state of Pennsylvania, not enough signatures. Big problem
RT @GovMikeHuckabee Trump says the chaos in Chicago was a planned attack. But Hillary insists it was a spontaneous reaction to an internet

Why would the great people of Florida vote for a guy who, as a Senator, never even shows up to vote  worst record. Marco Rubio is a joke
I have brought millions of people into the Republican Party, while the Dems are going down. Establishment wants to kill this movement
Failed candidate Mitt Romney,who ran one of the worst races in presidential history,is working with the establishment to bury a big R win
@malski1954 I changed parties to vote for you, no one else measures up to you, The GOPe needs a reality check. Our country is at stake

Ted Cruz does not have the right temperment to be President. Look at the way he totally panicked in firing his director of comm. BAD
Wow was Ted Cruz disloyal to his very capable director of communication. He used him as a scape goatfired like a dog Ted panicked.

Ted Cruz should be disqualified from his fraudulent win in Iowa. Weak RNC and Republican leadership probably wont let this happen Sad.
Just saw the phony ad by Cruz  totally false, more dirty tricks. He got caught in so many lies  is this man crazy
Ted Cruz has now apologized to Marco Rubio and Ben Carson for fraud and dirty tricks. No wonder he has lost Evangelical support
Ted Cruz has been playing an ad about me that is so ridiculously false  no basis in fact. Take ad down Ted. Biggest liar in politics
Wow, Ted Cruz falsely suggested Marco Rubio mocked the Bible and was just forced to fire his Communications Director. More dirty tricks
It is so important to audit The Federal Reserve, and yet Ted Cruz missed the vote on the bill that would allow this to be done.

@SandraR677582 @FLTrumpTeam Florida starts early voting on March 5 extending to March 15. Absentee ballots have been sent out #Trump2016
@ScotMReed No matter what liar sleazeball @rickwtyler says about @tedcruz in Tennessee. We have early voting and @realDonaldTrump has won.
I hear the Rickets family, who own the Chicago Cubs, are secretly spending s against me. They better be careful, they have a lot to hide
@1sonny12 @KSmith233035 @mitchellvii  FLORIDIANS ARE UPSET BECAUSE RUBIO DID NOT DO WHAT HE PROMISED ONCE HE WAS ELECTED VOTE TRUMP
@gregusp61 You really rocked them hard in S.C. Rubio and Cruz were pummled. So glad Jeb is gone Next no liar
The reason that Ted Cruz lost the Evangelicals in S.C. is because he is a world class LIAR, and Evangelicals do not like liars
I am in Las Vegas, at the best hotel by far, Trump International. I will be working with my wonderful teams and volunteers to WIN Nevada

RT @BretEastonEllis Just back from a dinner in West Hollywood shocked the majority of the table was voting for Trump but they would never
Thank you South Carolina  
A quote was read from a parody account last night on MSNBC re Jeb.  
The failing @WSJ Wall Street Journal should fire both its pollster and its Editorial Board. Seldom has a paper been so wrong.Totally biased
I will be live on all of the major morning talk shows. Enjoy

@CarrollKuykend2 This veteran just voted @realDonaldTrump in the SC primary, lets make America great again
South Carolina voters have the future of our country in their hands. Vote now today, and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN
Remember that Marco Rubio is very weak on illegal immigration. South Carolina needs strength as illegals and Syrians pour in. Dont allow it
I wonder if President Obama would have attended the funeral of Justice Scalia if it were held in a Mosque Very sad that he did not go
@Carolyn82471448 @WayneDupreeShow @realDonaldTrump All aboard the Trump Train
@JoeNBC Trump expressed concerns months after the Iraq War began, while 60 of Americans still supported the war.
