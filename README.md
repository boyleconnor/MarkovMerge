MarkovMerge
=============

Contributors
------------

MarkovMerge is Connor Boyle's re-adaptation of his individual work for
TwitterBot. TwitterBot was a project for the course COMP 221 at Macalester
College, developed with teammates Ayoub Belemlih and Andrew Cui.

MarkovMerge consists entirely of Connor's original Python code, other than data
sources including tweets scraped by Ayoub circa 2016, as well as several books
downloaded and reformatted from Project Gutenberg.

About
-----

MarkovMerge is an experiment in combining distinct sets of textual training
data to create maximally "erratic" or "neutral" probabilistically generated
texts.
